## Function Calling

Most of these Agentic examples rely on Function Calling, a feature that enhances large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to interact with external tools and APIs in a structured way, extending their capabilities beyond simple text generation. Function Calling equips LLMs with tools to perform actions such as making API calls, querying databases, executing code, or accessing external knowledge.

To enable Function Calling in Red Hat AI, refer to [this article](https://ai-on-openshift.io/odh-rhoai/enable-function-calling/).
